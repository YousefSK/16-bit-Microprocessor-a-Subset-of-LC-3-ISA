# 16-bit-Microprocessor-a-Subset-of-LC-3-ISA

In this lab, we designed a simple microprocessor using SystemVerilog, which is a subset of the LC-3 ISA. Like the LC-3 ISA, the microprocessor, Program Counter (PC), registers, and instructions will all be 16 bits. The Simplified LC-3 (SLC-3) will be able to fetch an instruction from memory, decode it, and then execute the instruction. The SLC-3 will have fewer instructions than the original LC-3, which means it will have a simpler FSM and a more straightforward control unit. This lab was divided into two parts. In the first part, we implement the fetch operation, which involves getting the desired instruction from the memory. In the second part, we constructed the full CPU unit to execute all the instructions.
